Until recently, if you wanted to run javascript outside the browser, you would use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Even now, node.js is *by far* the most popular runtime for javascript -- it has a massive community, and used ubiquitously across the internet, and can inevitably be found in any industry where you might find a computer.

The past few years, however, have seen some rival projects reach maturity, including [Deno](https://deno.land/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).  Although Bun looks intersting in its own right, in this post we will be focusing on Deno.

##  Deno

First, [install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation), with:

```bash
brew install deno
```

... if you are using a Mac, or:

```cmd
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

... if you are on Windows.

Make a [new github repo](https://github.com/new) called `deno_server`: 

![making a new repo called 'deno_server' on github](/etc/images/deno_new_repo.png)

... and clone it in your Documents folder (or wherever), with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deno_server.git
```

Make sure you are put your own username in the URL where it says `yourusername`

Open VSCode to that location:

![empty VSCode window, open at 'deno_server'](/etc/images/deno_vs_code_empty.png)

Save a new file called `server.js`, containing the following code:

```js
console.log (`hello from Deno!`)
```

Open up the terminal in VSCode with `ctrl` + `` ` `` and type:

```bash
deno run server.js
```

Deno should run the code in `server.js`, in which the `console.log ()` function prints its argument, `` `hello from Deno!` ``, to the terminal, like this:

![terminal in VSCode displaying "hello from Deno!"](/etc/images/deno_hello.png)

##  Serving a Static Site with Deno

If you followed the instructions in the Net Art Walkthrough post, you will have most probably been using a node.js script, [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), to serve your net art website.  In this section we will build a server that does this job, but from scratch, and with Deno.

Make a new directory inside the `deno_server` directory called `public` -- this is the directory we will put our website in.

In the newly created `public` folder, create an `index.html` file containing:

```html
<!doctype html>
<body>
    <script src=script.js></script>		
</body>
```

... and a `script.js` file containing:

```js
document.body.style.margin   = 0
document.body.style.overflow = `hidden`

const cnv = document.createElement (`canvas`)
cnv.width  = innerWidth
cnv.height = innerHeight

document.body.appendChild (cnv)

const ctx = cnv.getContext (`2d`)
ctx.fillStyle = `turquoise`
ctx.fillRect (0, 0, cnv.width, cnv.height)

const side = Math.min (cnv.width, cnv.height) / 3
const x_pos = (cnv.width / 2)  - (side / 2)
const y_pos = (cnv.height / 2) - (side / 2)

ctx.fillStyle = `deeppink`
ctx.fillRect (x_pos, y_pos, side, side)
```

Why not include a `favicon.ico` file from [here](https://favicon.io/) for good measure?

All together, your file structure should look like this:

![deno_server folder with server.js file and public folder, with index.html, script.js, and favicon.ico inside public](/etc/images/deno_file_structure.png)

Cycle back to your `server.js` file and delete the `console.log ()` call.

In order to serve the files we just created we will need to import the `serve ()` function from Deno's standard library.  The syntax for doing this in Deno, looks like this:

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/server.ts"
```

We can read about the `serve ()` function [here](https://deno.land/std@0.158.0/http/server.ts?s=serve).  You will notice that some of the syntax in this documentation looks a bit different -- this is because Deno uses [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  Try not to stress too much about this - it will also work just fine with our javascript.

What the documentation is telling us is that the `serve ()` function takes two arguments, the first being a handler function (of type [Handler](https://deno.land/std@0.158.0/http/server.ts?s=Handler)), and the second being an options object (of type [ServerInit](https://deno.land/std@0.158.0/http/server.ts?s=ServeInit)).


The handler function takes an http request as its argument, and returns a [Response object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), containing some content for the browser to display.  Let's define a handler function, and pass it to serve as the first argument:

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/server.ts"

serve (handler, { port: 80 })

function handler (req) {
    const content = "Hello, from the Deno server!!"
    return new Response (content)
}
```

Also note the second argument we are passing in to the `serve ()` function, an object with one property -- `port`, which we are setting to `80`, the default port used by the browser to display `http` content.

In the terminal, running the code again with `deno run server.js` should cause Deno to ask for net access permission:

![Deno asking for net access permission in the VSCode terminal](/etc/images/deno_allow-net.png)

Next time we run the code, we'll use:

```bash
deno run --allow-net server.js
```

... and the code should run without prompting us to give permission to serve content via an internet protocol.

This time, however, we can just give the required permissions by pressing `y`.  

The terminal should then display: `Listening on http://localhost:80`

If you go to a browser and type `localhost` into the URL bar, you should see something like this:

![a blank webpage that says "Hello, from the Deno server!!"](/etc/images/deno_first_serve.png)

Cycle back to the terminal, and press `ctrl` + `C` to shut down the server.

In order to serve the website in the public directory, we will want an additional function from the Deno standard library - `serveDir ()`.  You can read about `serveDir ()` [here](https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/file_server.ts?s=serveDir).

Note that `serveDir ()` accepts a request as its first argument, and an options object as its second argument -- it will serve whatever directory lies at the path location specified on the `fsRoot` property of the options object passed in as the second argument.

Consider the following code:

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/server.ts"
import { serveDir } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/file_server.ts"

serve (handler, { port: 80 })

function handler (req) {

    const options = {
        fsRoot: `public`
    }
    
    return serveDir (req, options)
}
```


Inside the `handler ()` function definition, we are creating an `options` object with one property, `fsRoot`, to which the path string `` `public` `` is assigned.  We are then passing in to the `serveDir ()` function, the request parameter that specifies the request `serve ()` will pass in to the `handler ()` function, and this `options` object that specifies the path of the directory we want `serve ()` to respond with.

Running this code with `deno run --allow-net server.js` looks like it is working.

However, if we cycle to a browser and try to navigate to `localhost`, we can see that nothing loads.  If we cycle back to the terminal, we can see that Deno is prompting us for more permissions -- this time it wants `--allow-read` so that it can access the file system and retrieve the contents of the `public` folder we have directed it to.  

We will include that flag next time we run it.  For the time being we can just press `y`.

Refreshing the browser at `localhost` should display this:

![browser window displaying the text: "Not Found"](/etc/images/deno_not_found.png)

The reason is because it doesn't assume you want to go to the `index.html` page.  Typing it into the URL bar explicitly, like this: `localhost/index.html`, should reveal the website:

![a website with a turquoise background and a pink square](/etc/images/deno_explicit_index.png)

We can code our server to default to `index.html` by including some conditional logic:

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/server.ts"
import { serveDir } from "https://deno.land/std@0.157.0/http/file_server.ts"

serve (handler, { port: 80 })

function handler (req) {

    const options = {
        fsRoot: `public`
    }

    if (req.url.endsWith (`/`)) {
        const aug_req = new Request (`${ req.url }index.html`, req)
        return serveDir (aug_req, options)
    }

    return serveDir (req, options)
}
```

Running this again, with: 

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.js
```

... should let us access the website from `localhost`:

![the same website (turquoise with a pink square), but from localhost instead of localhost/index.html](/etc/images/deno_default_to_index.png)

Git add / commit / push like this:

##  Deno Deploy

One of the really great things about Deno is the ability to push code to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).  Sign in and connect it to your GitHub account.

Once you are signed in, click on **New Project**.  You should be able to select your GitHub account, and search for `deno_server` in your repositories.  Select the main branch, and click **Automatic**.  Choose the `server.js` file, and click **Link**.

Once it is done linking your github repo, you should see a page like this:

![the Deno Deploy dashboard, with a "View" button](/etc/images/deno_deploy_dash.png)

Clicking on **View** will take you to where your server has been deployed:

![the turquoise website with a pink square, but hosted from a deno.dev URL](/etc/images/deno_deployed.png)

Note the URL where your code is live.  Pushing to your github repo will automatically deploy any changes here.
