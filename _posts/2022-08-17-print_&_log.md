p5 gives us a `print` function, which prints whatever we pass into it to the console.

For example, this code:

```javascript
function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)
    const msg = `Hello RMIT Creative Coding Specialisation!`
    print (msg)
}
```

... prints `Hello RMIT Creative Coding Specialisation!` to the console.

```javascript
function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)
    const result = 77 ** 3
    print (result)
}
```

... prints `456533`  to the console (77 to the power of three).

```javascript
function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)
    const is_equal = 5 * 7 == 6 * 6 
    print (is_equal)
}
```

... prints `false` to the console (because 5 x 7 does not equal 6 x 6).

Passing an object in to `print` gives a slightly different behaviour:

```javascript
// declaring variable "mid_point"
let mid_point 

function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)

    // creating a vector object and
    // storing it in mid_point
    mid_point = createVector (width / 2, height / 2)

    // passing the vector object in
    // as an argument to print
    print (mid_point)
}
```

Some information about the object is output on the console, along with a small triangle:

![vector object in the console](/etc/images/console_vector.png)

Clicking on the small triangle will unfold the object, displaying the object's **attributes** (data), and **methods** (behaviour).

Compare these with what you can find in [the documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector).

We will come back to objects when we talk about classes.  The takeaway here is that you can find out a lot about an object by printing it to the console.

#   `console.log`

Trying to call `print` in the global scope, ie. outside of the `setup` or `draw` functions: 

```javascript
print (`... and now for something completely different.`)

function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)
}


function draw () {
  background (220)
}
```

... causes some very different behaviour:

This is because `print` is repurposed inside p5.  Under the hood, p5 is actually calling `console.log ()`, which works both inside the special p5 functions, and oustide them:

```javascript
console.log (`... and we're back.`)

function setup () {
    createCanvas (400, 400)
}


function draw () {
  background (220)
}
```

I generally use `console.log ()`, as it is useful for debugging regardless of whether I am using p5.
