I will note that it is "standard practice" to use American spellings for words like "colour" in the domain of computer science.  However, I can't quite bring myself to spell it "color" unless I absolutely need to.  Official javascript and p5 use the spelling "color", and when I have a choice about how to spell it, I usually choose to spell it "colour".

##  Using colour

Many p5 functions take a colour as their argument, perhaps the most common being `fill ()` and `background ()`.  These functions, as well as p5's `color ()` function, which returns a `color` object, offer a variety of ways to deal with colour - different paradigms which work slightly differently.

All paradigms are [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_color), which means, as a rule, they operate in values between `0` - `255`.  The exception is `HSB`, which we will discuss later in the post, and colour *keywords*.

### Keywords

There is a list of colours which you can pass into `color ()`, `fill ()`, or `background ()`, as strings.  Some of my favourites are `'turquoise'`, `'hotpink'`, and `'tomato'`.  Just be sure to remember to put quotation marks around them, so javascript knows to treat them as a string.  You can find a list of colour keywords [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color_keywords).

### Greyscale

Giving one numerical argument to `color ()`, `fill ()`, or `background ()` will result in a greyscale colour: `0` yields black, `255` yields white, and all the values in between yield various shades of grey.

Consider the following sketch:

```javascript   
function setup () {
  createCanvas (450, 150)
  frameRate (16)

  textAlign (CENTER, CENTER)
  textSize (64)
  noStroke ()
}

function draw() {
  
  // shade iterates with frameCount
  const shade = frameCount % 256

  // set the background colour
  // with the value in shade
  background (shade)
  
  fill (255) // white text
  text (shade, 150, 75) // display value of shade

  fill (0)  // black text
  text (shade, 300, 75) // display value of shade
}
```

<iframe width=450 height=192 src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/zVSNqyB9c"></iframe>

As `frameCount` increases, the colour of the background goes from black to white.

### Greyscale + Alpha

Giving  `color ()`, `fill ()`, or `background ()` two arguments will specify greyscale and alpha values.  Alpha represents how opaque a colour is, and low alpha values make the colour more transparent.

Consider the following sketch:

```javascript
let shade // declaring shade in the global scope
          // so it will persist between frames

function setup () {
  createCanvas (450, 150)
  frameRate (16)

  rectMode (CENTER)
  textAlign (CENTER, CENTER)
  textSize (64)
  noStroke ()
  
  shade = rand_256 ()
}

function draw() {
  
  // alph iterates with frameCount
  const alph = frameCount % 256

  if (alph == 0) {
    // when alph resets to 0
    // reassign to shade
    // a random value between 0-255
    shade = rand_256 ()
  }
  
  // draw the square first
  square (300, 77, 75)
  
  // draw the background over the square
  // with the greyscale and alpha values
  background (shade, alph)
  
  fill (`hotpink`) // white text
  text (alph, 150, 75) // display value of alph

}

function rand_256 () {
  const r = random (256) // generate a random value
                         // between 0-255

    return floor (r) // chop off any decimal places
                     // & return the integer
}
```

<iframe width=450 height=192 src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/Vm7HboRb_"></iframe>

Here the background is being drawn over the top of the pink square on the right, which is why, when `alph` values get close to `255`, the pink square disappears.

Also note that at low values for `alph`, because the colour is quite transparent, when the background is drawn, it does not hide the content already on the canvas.  Trails, or *echos*, of previous frames remain visible, which clear up as `alph` values approach `255` and the background becomes more opaque.

### RGB: Red, Green, Blue

Giving  `color ()`, `fill ()`, or `background ()` three arguments will specify a red, green, and blue values, each, again, between `0` - `255`.

Cosider the following sketch.

<iframe width=450 height=192 src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/HX4_wytFl"></iframe>

The number represents the red value in the first square, the green value in the second, and the blue value in the third.  The other values are static while the numbers increase, and then randomised when the numbers reset.  View the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/HX4_wytFl).

Consider the following code:

```javascript
function setup () {
  createCanvas (400, 400)
  frameRate (2)
  noStroke ()
}

function draw () {
  background (220)
  for (let y = 0; y < height; y += 20) {
    for (let x = 0; x < width; x += 20) {
      fill (rand_colour ())
      square (x, y, 20)      
    }  
  }
}

function rand_colour () {
  const r = floor (random (256))
  const g = floor (random (256))
  const b = floor (random (256))
  return color (r, g, b)
}
```

Note the function at the bottom - random integer values between `0` - `255` are chosen for variables `r`, `g`, and `b`.  Those values are then passed to the constructor method `color ()` which returns a p5 `color` object, which is then returned by the function.

You can see it being used to generate random colours for the `fill ()` function in the nested for loops, which generate the 20 x 20 grid rendered to the canvas:

### RGBA: Red, Green, Blue, & Alpha

Passing four values in to `color ()`, `fill ()`, or `background ()` will signal to p5 that you wish to use RGBA mode - the fourth value indicating the alpha, or opacity, again between `0` - `255`.

The following sketch is similar to the last sketch, but the alpha values of the randomly generated colours are being modulated by a sinusoid, periodically revealing the image drawn underneath:

View the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/ycN7bzw1_).

### HSB: Hue, Saturation, and Brightness

We can change how p5 interprets the values we pass into `color ()`, `fill ()`, and `background ()` by switching [colour mode](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/colorMode).  The default mode p5 starts in is `RGB`, but we can switch to `HSB` mode by calling `colorMode (HSB)`.

In `HSB` mode, the first argument is the hue, interpreted as an angle between `0` - `360` that travels around a hue circle.  

<iframe width=400 height=442 src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/GGKmdZuVg"></iframe>

At 0째, the hue is red.  At 360째, the hue returns to red.  Between 0째 and 360째, the hue transforms through all the colours of the rainbow.  Click on the p5 canvas below:

The second argument, saturation, operates between `0` - `100`.

The third argument, brightness, also operates between `0` - `100`.

Note that in HSB mode, alpha, the fourth argument, operates at values between `0` - `1`, rather than `0` - `255`.

#   lerpColor

The `lerpColor ()` function lets you morph smoothly between colours.  It takes two colours and a value between `0` - `1` as arguments, and returns a third colour:
