The `random ()` function in p5 (which you can read about [here](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random)) is similar to the more common `Math.random ()` function, (which you can read about [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)), but with some extra features built in.

##  No arguments

Just by itself, p5's `random ()` behaves exactly like `Math.random ()` -- it returns a value between `0` and `1`.  It might very, *very* occasionally return a value of exactly `0`, but it will never return a value of exactly `1`, only values very close to it.

##  One numerical argument

Giving p5's `random ()` a single numerical value specifies a maximum.  In this case, the function returns a random value between `0` and that maximum.  For example, `random (2)` will return a decimal value between `0` and `2`.

##  Two numerical arguments

Giving p5's `random ()` two numerical values specifies a minimum, and a maximum.  For example `random (2, 8)` will return a random decimal value between `2` and `8`.

##  An array

If you give p5's `random ()` function an array, it will select one of the elements of that array at random, and return it.
